Welcome! <br>

This is a web interface for the collaborate creation of a knowledge graph concerning automotive diagnostics. <br>

The underlying ontology can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/tbohne/OBDOntology"> here</a>. The goal is to expand
the knowledge captured in this knowledge graph by filling the ontology with instances. <br>

You can add instances of <br>

<a href="dtc_form">DTCs</a>, <br>

<a href="subsystem_form">vehicle subsystems</a> <br>

and <br>

<a href="component_form">components</a>.
